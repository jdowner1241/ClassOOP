/*
Question 1
•	Declare an integer type variable name intNumber and assign it a value of 30.
•	Declare a float type variable name floatNumber and assign it a value of 30.78.
•	Declare a double type variable name doubleNumber and assign it a value of 45.1234.
•	Declare a bool type variable name boolean and assign it a value of true.
•	Declare a char type variable name charName and assign it a value of u.
•	Lastly, print the values of all declared variables.

Question 2
Write some code which will take your name, address and phone number as input from the terminal and print on the console.

Question 3
Create a program that prompts the user for a temperature
in degrees Fahrenheit, converts it to Celsius,and displays the result.
It should use integer variables. **(32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C

Question 4
Create a program that prompts the user to type in a floating-point number
representing the radius of a circle. The program should then calculate and
display the circle’s area. **A = πr2. π = 3.14
